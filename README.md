# AWS Learning Journey & Portfolio

**This repository documents my journey transforming a small fullstack application into a robust, scalable cloud infrastructure using Docker, Kubernetes, Pulumi, and AWS.**

## 📚 Skills & Topics Showcase
- Fullstack development
- Containerization (Docker)
- Orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Infrastructure as Code (Pulumi)
- Cloud deployment (AWS)
- Scalability, robustness, CI/CD, monitoring
- Learning logs, reflections, and architectural documentation

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap
1. **Portfolio Planning & Documentation**: Define vision, objectives, and documentation
2. **Fullstack Prototype**: Build core app, document project decisions
3. **Containerization with Docker**: Dockerize app, explain process
4. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploy app with Kubernetes, share lessons
5. **Infrastructure as Code (Pulumi)**: Automate provisioning, document migration
6. **Cloud Deployment & Scalability**: Deploy to AWS, scale, add monitoring
7. **Portfolio Showcase & Reflections**: GitHub Pages site and write-ups
